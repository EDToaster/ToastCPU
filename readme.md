# Toast CPU
`toast` is a 16-bit architecture spec, an emulator, an FPGA implementation, and an assembler.

Read documents on the [architecture](spec/arch.md), and the [application binary interface](spec/abi.md).

# Todo
- [ ] Fix assembler to include calling convention and register renamings
- [ ] Fix the emulator, create an emulated screen
- [ ] Finish VGA text mode (Maybe a smaller VGA text mode font for more lines)
- [ ] Implement elementary OS / Basic interpreter
- [ ] Extend functionality of assembler
- [ ] Implement a compiler backend for C->`toast` compilation
- [ ] Add floating point module, maybe a 32-bit variant?
